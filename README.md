# PortfolioWebsite

This was written using angularJS, HTML5, CSS, and other technologies.

I couldn't upload all of my Angular files so just download the same version I used if you want to recreate

mail.php is intentionally left as a template to use phpMailer

Just to display the code I used for my website
